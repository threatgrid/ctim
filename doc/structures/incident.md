# *Incident* Object

*Incident* Information about computer security incident response. A computer security
   incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer
   security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.
   Incidents pertain to one or more *adverse events*, each of which is modeled
   as a [sighting](sighting.md).

| Property | Type | Description | Required? |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
|[confidence](#propertyconfidence-highmedlowstring)|HighMedLowString|Represents the level of certainty or trustworthiness associated with the incident. It denotes the reliability of the intelligence associated with the incident. The `confidence` field can take on several values, including: - `info`: Indicates that the incident information is based on sources with no previous track record or there is no track record for the source reporting the incident. - `low`: Indicates that the incident information is based on sources with a questionable track record or there is limited information about the accuracy of the source. - `medium`: Indicates that the incident information is based on sources with a mixed track record or of uncertain reliability. - `high`: Indicates that the incident information is based on sources with a proven track record and high degree of reliability. The `confidence` field can be used to indicate the level of trust and confidence that can be attributed to the incident, and it may impact how the incident is prioritized, analyzed and addressed. It can also help in the decision-making process associated with the incident response activities. It is important to note that the `confidence` field is subjective and can be interpreted differently by different organizations or analysts. As such, it is often used in conjunction with other intelligence attributes, such as the `severity` field, to provide a more complete picture of the incident.|&#10003;|

|[external_ids](#propertyexternal_ids-stringlist)|String List|It is used to store a list of external identifiers that can be linked to the incident, providing a reliable and manageable way to correlate and group related events across multiple data sources. It is especially useful in larger organizations that rely on multiple security information and event management (SIEM) systems to detect security incidents. For instance, it can be used to track events across different network sensors, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), or log management platforms.   The field can also be used to facilitate automation and orchestration workflows, where additional information can be shared among incident management systems. It can be used to cross-reference with other external tools such as threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability scanners.||

The primary purpose of this field is to help analysts filter and prioritize entities based on their knowledge and expertise of different languages.  For example, if an incident involves an attack on a system in a country where a specific language is predominant, the `language` field can be used to indicate that language, which can help analysts to quickly identify and respond to incidents that may be geographically or culturally relevant. This information can be used to prioritize incidents based on their potential impact. The `language` field can also be used to help with correlation of incidents across different systems and regions, as well as to help with data analysis and reporting.||

It helps organizations prioritize and allocate resources for incident response based on the severity level of the incident  It helps analysts and incident handlers prioritize incidents by indicating the level of risk and potential impact associated with the incident. This enables organizations to allocate resources efficiently and address the most critical incidents first. Can also be used to generate reports and metrics for measuring the effectiveness of the incident response process and to identify trends and patterns in the threat landscape. It is important to note that the `severity` field is subjective and can be interpreted differently by different organizations or analysts. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other intelligence attributes, such as the `confidence` field, to provide a more comprehensive view of the incident.||

This allows recipients to determine the appropriate handling and dissemination of the information based on their clearance level and need-to-know.  For example, an entity containing information about a critical vulnerability in a widely-used software might be marked as `red`, indicating that it should only be shared with a small group of highly trusted individuals who need to know in order to take appropriate action. On the other hand, a message containing more general information about security threats might be marked as `amber` or `green`, indicating that it can be shared more broadly within an organization.||
