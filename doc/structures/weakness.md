|[external_ids](#propertyexternal_ids-stringlist)|String List|It is used to store a list of external identifiers that can be linked to the incident, providing a reliable and manageable way to correlate and group related events across multiple data sources. It is especially useful in larger organizations that rely on multiple security information and event management (SIEM) systems to detect security incidents. For instance, it can be used to track events across different network sensors, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), or log management platforms.   The field can also be used to facilitate automation and orchestration workflows, where additional information can be shared among incident management systems. It can be used to cross-reference with other external tools such as threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability scanners.||
|[external_references](#propertyexternal_references-externalreferenceobjectlist)|*ExternalReference* Object List|Specifies a list of external references which refers to non-CTIM information.  Similar to `external_ids` field with major differences:  - `external_ids` field is used to store a list of external identifiers that can be used to link entities across different data sources. These identifiers are typically standardized and well-known, such as CVE IDs, US-CERT advisories, or other industry-standard threat intelligence feeds. The `external_ids` field can be used to facilitate automation and orchestration workflows, where additional information can be shared among incident management systems.   - `external_references` field, on the other hand, is used to provide a more general mechanism for linking entities to external sources of information.

|[language](#propertylanguage-shortstringstring)|ShortStringString|The `language` field is used to specify the primary language of the affected system or the target of an attack. It can be used to provide additional context and information about the entity. The primary purpose of this field is to help analysts filter and prioritize entities based on their knowledge and expertise of different languages.  For example, if an incident involves an attack on a system in a country where a specific language is predominant, the `language` field can be used to indicate that language, which can help analysts to quickly identify and respond to incidents that may be geographically or culturally relevant. This information can be used to prioritize incidents based on their potential impact. The `language` field can also be used to help with correlation of incidents across different systems and regions, as well as to help with data analysis and reporting.||

<a id="propertyabstraction_level-weaknessabstractionlevelstring"></a>
## Property abstraction_level âˆ· WeaknessAbstractionLevelString

Refers to the level of abstraction or granularity used to describe the weakness. It helps to categorize the vulnerability based on the level of detail provided.

* This entry is optional


  * *WeaknessAbstractionLevel* Refers to the level of abstraction or granularity used to describe the weakness. It helps to categorize the vulnerability based on the level of detail provided. CTIM provides four different levels of abstraction for weaknesses: Class, Base, Variant, and Compound. 

- Class: is the highest level of abstraction and describes a general category of weaknesses. Examples of Classes include :"Buffer Errors", "Input Validation", or "Authentication Issues". 

- Base: More specific category than Class. A Base weakness is a concrete form of a Class weakness. An example of a Base weakness could be "SQL Injection".

- Variant: Describes one specific type of Base weakness that is defined by alterations or extensions to the Base description. For example, "Blind SQL Injection" can be considered a Variant of the Base weakness "SQL Injection". 

- Compound: A Compound Weakness describes a weakness that combines two or more Base weaknesses to exploit a system. For example, a "Buffer-Overflow with Format-String Exploit" combines the Base weaknesses of "Buffer-Overflow" and "Format-String Vulnerability". 

By specifying the abstraction level, cybersec professionals can more easily identify weaknesses that are related and prioritize their response efforts based on the potential impact of the vulnerability.

* This entry is optional


  * *WeaknessStructure* Structural nature of a weakness. Useful as it categorizes weaknesses based on their dependencies and complexity and helps analysts to prioritize their response efforts based on the potential impact of the vulnerability.

- Chain: A chain weakness might involve an attacker chaining together multiple   vulnerabilities and exploits in order to achieve their end goal. For example,   an attacker might use a phishing attack to gain access to a user's email   account, then use information from that account to socially engineer their way   through additional systems until they gain access to an internal network. In   this case, the attacker is chaining multiple weaknesses together in order to   achieve their ultimate objective.

- Composite: A composite weakness might involve multiple vulnerabilities that   exist in different layers or components of a system. For example, a composite   weakness in a web application might involve both an injection vulnerability   and a cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker could use these   weaknesses in tandem to steal data or take over the system.

- Simple: A simple weakness might involve a single vulnerability or exploit that   can be used to achieve a specific objective. An example of a simple weakness   might be a buffer overflow vulnerability in a software application. If an   attacker can exploit this vulnerability, they may be able to execute arbitrary   code on the system.

For example, an entity containing information about a critical vulnerability in a widely-used software might be marked as `red`, indicating that it should only be shared with a small group of highly trusted individuals who need to know in order to take appropriate action. On the other hand, a message containing more general information about security threats might be marked as `amber` or `green`, indicating that it can be shared more broadly within an organization.
