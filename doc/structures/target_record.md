# *TargetRecord* Object

*TargetRecord* A TargetRecord is a Sighting that has no threat or observables associated
  with it, it's a way of saying they saw a set of observables together as a Target.

| Property | Type | Description | Required? |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
|[id](#propertyid-string)|String|Globally unique URI identifying this object.|&#10003;|
|[schema_version](#propertyschema_version-string)|String|CTIM schema version for this entity.|&#10003;|
|[source](#propertysource-medstringstring)|MedStringString|Represents the source of the intelligence that led to the creation of the entity.|&#10003;|
|[targets](#propertytargets-targetobjectlist)|*Target* Object List| |&#10003;|
|[type](#propertytype-targetrecordtypeidentifierstring)|TargetRecordTypeIdentifierString| |&#10003;|
|[description](#propertydescription-markdownstring)|MarkdownString|A description of object, which may be detailed.||
|[external_ids](#propertyexternal_ids-stringlist)|String List|It is used to store a list of external identifiers that can be linked to the incident, providing a reliable and manageable way to correlate and group related events across multiple data sources. It is especially useful in larger organizations that rely on multiple security information and event management (SIEM) systems to detect security incidents. For instance, it can be used to track events across different network sensors, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), or log management platforms.   The field can also be used to facilitate automation and orchestration workflows, where additional information can be shared among incident management systems. It can be used to cross-reference with other external tools such as threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability scanners.||
|[external_references](#propertyexternal_references-externalreferenceobjectlist)|*ExternalReference* Object List|Specifies a list of external references which refers to non-CTIM information.  Similar to `external_ids` field with major differences:  - `external_ids` field is used to store a list of external identifiers that can be used to link entities across different data sources. These identifiers are typically standardized and well-known, such as CVE IDs, US-CERT advisories, or other industry-standard threat intelligence feeds. The `external_ids` field can be used to facilitate automation and orchestration workflows, where additional information can be shared among incident management systems.   - `external_references` field, on the other hand, is used to provide a more general mechanism for linking entities to external sources of information. The `external_references` field can include references to blog posts, articles, external documents, threat intelligence reports, and other sources of information that may not have a standardized format or identifier.||
|[language](#propertylanguage-shortstringstring)|ShortStringString|The `language` field is used to specify the primary language of the affected system or the target of an attack. It can be used to provide additional context and information about the entity. The primary purpose of this field is to help analysts filter and prioritize entities based on their knowledge and expertise of different languages.  For example, if an incident involves an attack on a system in a country where a specific language is predominant, the `language` field can be used to indicate that language, which can help analysts to quickly identify and respond to incidents that may be geographically or culturally relevant. This information can be used to prioritize incidents based on their potential impact. The `language` field can also be used to help with correlation of incidents across different systems and regions, as well as to help with data analysis and reporting.||
|[revision](#propertyrevision-integer)|Integer|A monotonically increasing revision, incremented each time the object is changed.||
|[short_description](#propertyshort_description-medstringstring)|MedStringString|A single line, short summary of the object.||
|[source_uri](#propertysource_uri-string)|String|URI of the source of the intelligence that led to the creation of the entity.||
|[timestamp](#propertytimestamp-instdate)|Inst (Date)|The time this object was created at, or last modified.||
|[title](#propertytitle-shortstringstring)|ShortStringString|A short title for this object, used as primary display and reference value.||
|[tlp](#propertytlp-tlpstring)|TLPString|TLP stands for [Traffic Light Protocol](https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp), which indicates precisely how a resource is intended to be shared, replicated, copied, etc.  It is used to indicate the sensitivity of the information contained within the message. This allows recipients to determine the appropriate handling and dissemination of the information based on their clearance level and need-to-know.  For example, an entity containing information about a critical vulnerability in a widely-used software might be marked as `red`, indicating that it should only be shared with a small group of highly trusted individuals who need to know in order to take appropriate action. On the other hand, a message containing more general information about security threats might be marked as `amber` or `green`, indicating that it can be shared more broadly within an organization.||
