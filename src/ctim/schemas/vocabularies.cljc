       "represented by the metric Authorization Scope, "
       "or simply Scope. Formally, Scope refers to the collection "

       "(e.g. an application, an operating system, or a sandbox environment) "
       "when granting access to computing resources "
       "(e.g. files, CPU, memory, etc). These privileges are assigned "

       "traffic that arrives on its ports and is an authority "
       "that controls the traffic flow to other switch ports. "
       "When the vulnerability of a software component governed by "

       "has occurred. Intuitively, one may think of a scope "

       "vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. "

       "assertions of the research, or the author or vendor "
       "of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. "
       "`reasonable`: Significant details are published, but researchers either "
       "do not have full confidence in the root cause, or do not have "
       "access to source code to fully confirm all of the interactions "
       "that may lead to the result. Reasonable confidence exists, "
       "however, that the bug is reproducible and at least one impact "
       "is able to be verified (proof-of-concept exploits may provide this). "
