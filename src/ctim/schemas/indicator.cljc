closely, with the exception of not including observables within the
indicator, and preferring a _specification_ object encoded in JSON as
opposed to an opaque _implementation_ block.

Additional, you will want to either define judgements against
Observables that are linked to this indicator, with the ID in the
_indicators_ field of those Judgements, or you can provide a
_specification_ value.")
